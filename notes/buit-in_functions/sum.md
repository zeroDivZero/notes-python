# `sum`

```python
sum(iterable, /, start=0)
```

Sums `start` and items in `iterable` from left to right and returns total.

For some use cases, there are better alternatives. To concatenate strings, preferred, faster way is `''.join(sequence)`. To add floating-point values with extended precision, see `math.fsum()`. To concatenate series of iterables, consider `itertools.chain()`.
