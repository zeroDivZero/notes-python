# STYLE GUIDE

Prefer readability over writeability.

## Indentation

4 spaces per indentation. Don't use tabs, especially when mixed with spaces.

## Line Length

Less than 80 characters per line. Limit comment to 72 characters (some auto-documentation tools add formatting characters).

## Blank Lines

Group parts of program visually, but not excessively.
