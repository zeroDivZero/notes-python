# OVERVIEW

High-level, general-purpose programming language. Design philosophy emphasizes readability with use of significant indentation.

Uses dynamic typing and combination of reference counting and cycle-detecting garbage collection. Uses dynamic name resolution (late binding) that binds method and variable names during execution.

Supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional. Often described as "batteries included" due to comprehensive standard lib.

Modular approach with small core, highly extensible.

Strives for simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar. Embraces "there should only be one obvious way" philosophy.
